# Random Colour Generator
Colour Wheel uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, & PHP, and was one of my first JavaScript projects. It has two buttons; the one on the left picks a random colour when clicked, and the one on the right cycles through random colors when you grab and scroll with the mouse. PHP was used to add the live time and date to the header and footer.
